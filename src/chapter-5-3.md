AI technology can improve performance management by automating repetitive tasks and providing real-time feedback and coaching to employees. For example, AI-powered performance management tools can analyze employee performance data to provide insights into strengths and weaknesses, allowing managers to provide targeted feedback and coaching. This leads to improved employee engagement and satisfaction, as well as higher levels of productivity and performance.

Conclusion
