Additionally, predictive analytics software such as IBM Watson Studio and RapidMiner can help small businesses make informed decisions based on data analysis.

Difficulty in Competing with Larger Organizations

Small businesses may struggle to compete with larger organizations due to their limited resources and market presence. However, AI can help small businesses personalize customer engagement and improve brand reputation. Natural language processing algorithms can analyze customer feedback to identify areas for improvement, while computer vision can be used for quality control in manufacturing.
